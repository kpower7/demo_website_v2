# Project Summary

This project is a real‑time MLB voice assistant that combines ElevenLabs’ Agent platform with a secure tool bridge and a FastAPI backend to deliver concise game insights, scouting, and betting leans. The Next.js frontend hosts a voice chat page (`/voice`) that connects to an ElevenLabs Agent over WebSocket using a Netlify Function broker (`netlify/functions/elevenSignedUrl.ts`). Answers are spoken aloud and presented on screen in short, actionable sentences.

Core baseball intelligence is provided by a Python FastAPI service (`backend/`) exposing five tools under `/tools/*`: `check_schedule`, `compare_stats`, `news`, `youtube`, and `team_intelligence`. Each endpoint is protected by a token (`x-tool-token`) and proxied by Netlify Functions (e.g., `toolsCheckSchedule.ts`) so the agent never calls the backend directly. The backend integrates MLB stats, NewsAPI, and YouTube search to summarize matchups, injuries, and recent analysis content. A focused betting layer adds a simple, transparent “lean” (side/total or pass) with a low/medium/high confidence indicator—strictly as educational guidance.

Reliability and security were prioritized: timezone‑aware schedule handling, robust error paths (e.g., safe fallbacks for YouTube), dependency pinning, strict POST+JSON contracts, CORS via the proxy, and secrets confined to environment variables. Deployment is split for resilience—Netlify for the web UI and functions, and a dedicated host for FastAPI (e.g., Render). The result is a fast, production‑ready assistant that turns live baseball data into a compact narrative and a clear recommendation, enabling fans to make smarter, safer, and more informed decisions in seconds.
